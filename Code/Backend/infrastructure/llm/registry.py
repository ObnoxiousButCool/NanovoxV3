"""Provider registry.

Turns a provider name plus configuration into a live adapter. This is where
a missing API key becomes a clear error, and it is the only place that
knows which providers exist — adding one is a single entry here plus an
adapter.

Only three providers are wired: OpenAI (default), Anthropic and Ollama
(decision D1). Azure Foundry is not ported; the registry stays shaped so it
could be added later, but nothing in ``FACTORIES`` names it.

Selection never falls back. If the requested provider cannot be
constructed, the call fails; substituting a different model would
invalidate the provenance recorded against every stored analysis.
