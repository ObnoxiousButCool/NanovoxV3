"""Shared behaviour for every model provider.

Retry, schema validation, the repair attempt and the audit record live
here, not in the adapters. An adapter's only job is to make one call and
translate its own failures into this module's vocabulary — which is why
adding a provider cannot accidentally come with different retry semantics.

Two failure kinds are treated very differently:

* **Transient** (network, timeout, 429, 5xx) — the request never produced
  an answer, so it is retried with exponential backoff.
* **Schema violation** — the model answered, but not in the required
  shape. That is retried exactly once, with the validation errors fed back
  as a correction. Retrying it further just spends money on the same
  mistake.
