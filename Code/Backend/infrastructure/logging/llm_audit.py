"""Audit trail for every model call.

One line per attempt, in its own file, recording provider, model, prompt id
and version, tokens, latency and outcome — what answers "which model
produced this score, and what did it cost?" later on, since every figure on
the dashboard is model-derived (plan §7, "Provenance on every analysis").

Prompt and response bodies are written **only** when ``LOG_LLM_PROMPTS`` is
true. The default is false: transcripts are member conversations, and an
audit log is not the place to accumulate them.
