"""Runs work in the background of the API process (plan §8 Phase 3,
"run orchestration... resumability").

Generic over what the work actually is — a run over a set of calls in
Phase 4's pipeline, or anything else keyed by an integer id — so this file
doesn't need to change again once that consumer exists.

Two details here are the difference between working and appearing to work.

**Task references are held.** ``asyncio`` keeps only a weak reference to a
task, so a fire-and-forget ``create_task`` can be garbage collected
mid-run — the classic way a background job silently stops existing.

**Failures are logged.** A task that raises with nobody awaiting it
produces nothing but a "Task exception was never retrieved" warning at
interpreter exit, long after anyone could act on it. Every task gets a
done-callback that records what happened.
