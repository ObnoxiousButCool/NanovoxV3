"""Declarative base for the ORM mapping.

The explicit naming convention matters: without it SQLite leaves indexes and
constraints unnamed, and Alembic then cannot generate a reversible migration
for them. Setting it before the first table is created avoids a painful
correction later.

Table definitions arrive with the phase that introduces them (Phase 1
onward); this module intentionally defines only the base and its metadata.
