"""Async SQLAlchemy engine and session factory.

SQLite is configured for the access pattern this application will have: a
background extraction run writing while the dashboard reads. Write-ahead
logging lets readers proceed during a write, and a busy timeout turns a
transient lock into a short wait instead of an immediate ``database is
locked`` error. Postgres needs none of this — a real database server already
handles concurrent readers and writers itself — so the pragmas below are
conditional on the engine actually being SQLite.
