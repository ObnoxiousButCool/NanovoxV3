"""Settings factory for tests.

Tests must not be influenced by a developer's local ``.env``: a passing
suite has to mean the code is correct, not that someone's machine happens to
be configured a particular way. The subclass below disables dotenv loading
through ``model_config`` — which is type-checked — rather than by passing
the private ``_env_file`` keyword, which is not part of the public typed
signature.
