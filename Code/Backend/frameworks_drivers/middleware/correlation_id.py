"""Correlation ID middleware.

Honours an inbound ``X-Correlation-ID`` so a caller can trace a request
across services, and generates one otherwise. The value is bound to the
context for the lifetime of the request and echoed back on the response.

Must be the outermost middleware: anything registered outside it would log
without a correlation ID.
