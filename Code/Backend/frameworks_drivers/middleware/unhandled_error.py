"""Catch-all for unanticipated exceptions.

This is deliberately middleware rather than an
``@app.exception_handler(Exception)``. Starlette routes a handler registered
for ``Exception`` to ``ServerErrorMiddleware``, which sits outside every user
middleware — so its response never passes back through the correlation
middleware and would reach the client with no ``X-Correlation-ID`` header.
Catching here, inside the correlation scope, means every error response the
client sees can be traced to a log entry.

``ServerErrorMiddleware`` still stands behind this as the final backstop for
a failure in the middleware stack itself.
