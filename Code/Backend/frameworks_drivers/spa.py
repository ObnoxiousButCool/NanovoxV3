"""Serve the built frontend from the API process.

One process and one origin, which removes a surprising amount: no CORS, no
separate web server, no SPA fallback rule to configure, and no rebuilding the
bundle when the API's address changes — it becomes a relative path.

Mounted only when a build is actually present. In development the frontend
is served by Vite on its own port, and the absence of ``dist`` is the normal
state rather than a misconfiguration.
