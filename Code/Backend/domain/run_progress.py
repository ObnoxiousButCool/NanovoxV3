"""Progress of a run over a set of calls, computed from its items.

Progress is derived, never stored. A stored counter and a table of items
are two sources of truth that drift the moment a process dies between the
two writes, and the run record is precisely the thing that has to survive
a crash (plan §8 Phase 3, "resumability").

The four outcomes are reported separately rather than as "done / not
done". A run that skipped ninety calls and analysed ten is not the same
event as one that analysed a hundred, and a progress bar that showed both
as full would say it was.
