"""States a run over a set of calls, and one call's place within it.

Two enums rather than one: a run and a single call fail for different
reasons and recover differently. An item that fails leaves the run
healthy — one call the pipeline couldn't finish is not a failed run — so
the run's own status must not be derivable from any single item's.

``INTERRUPTED`` is deliberately distinct from ``FAILED``. A run whose
process died was not rejected by anything; it stopped mid-flight and its
remaining work is still valid. Collapsing the two would hide the one case
that is resumable.
